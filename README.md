# Drop Solutions

A javascript-based chrome extension that allows users to donate
a certain amount of water based on the time that they've been productive.

Productivity is tracked by the amount of time the user DOES NOT spend on
websites that they've added to the block list. 

A real-time timer appears as the user clicks the app icon.
